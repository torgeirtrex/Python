This is the first application I wrote using the Flask framework for Python and is made for self training purposes.

The application is a Create-Read-Update-Delete application that let's the user manage a music database on a SQL Lite database file.
I have added an javascript that uses an Ajax request to Wikipedia and handles the response that is received from the API.
